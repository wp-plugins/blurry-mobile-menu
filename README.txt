Blurry uses your WordPress theme standard menu as a source to build an original responsive menu with impressive appearance effects and sleek animations.

== Description ==

[Demo here](http://blurry.looks-awesome.com/ "Blurry demo")

Navigation is a very important part of user experience and Blurry makes it easier for small screens. It uses cutting-edge CSS3 techniques like blur effect for whole page (with fallbacks if blur is not supported) and various animations for menus.

Blurry is not just another one of the hundreds of average drop down menus you’ve seen on WordPress websites. This plugin makes the background blur in sleek and amazing way when the navigation displays. Your website starts to look like custom mobile application or game if you wish.

Blurry supports multi-level navigation with no limitation in depth. The easy tap-tap interface is obvious and does not detract visitors. For better navigation on your website the plugin includes built-in search which is optional. Overall Blurry is all about best UI/UX practices combined with amazing design.

This Plugin works on iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows Mobile if device browser supports required features, if not the menu won’t generate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Blurry uses WordPress menu mapped to location specified on Blurry options page as source to generate the responsive menu. It can replace existing menu. You can edit these menus and its mappings in Appearance/Menus. Blurry requires standard WordPress 3 menu structure to work.

= Where I can find settings? =
Settings are located in WP Admin on Settings/Blurry Mobile Menu page

= Does it replace default menu? =
You can set plugin to do so on settings page. But this won't work in 100% due to different approaches from theme authors

Plugin is distrubuted "as is" and doesn't contain support services. However it can be our good will to help you.
